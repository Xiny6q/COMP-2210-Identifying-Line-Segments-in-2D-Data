COMP 2210 Identifying Line Segments in 2D Data
Problem Overview

This assignment will explore an example feature extraction problem. Feature extraction is a subproblem of pattern recognition and is also used in areas such as statistical analysis, computer vision, and image processing. For example, an image processing problem may use a feature extraction algorithm to identify particular shapes or regions in a digitized image.

In this assignment, weâ€™re going to focus on a very simple feature extraction problem: Given a set of points in two-dimensional space, identify every subset of four or more points that are collinear. For example, given the set of points depicted in Figure 1, your program would detect the three groups of collinear points as depicted by the line segments in Figure 2.
